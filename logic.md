# MAXI ROE Rules and Logic

MAXI ROE operates based on the following key rules and logic frameworks to ensure optimal dismantling and part profitability.

## 1. Part Categorization and Vehicle Matching

- **Rule**: Parts are matched to vehicles where they physically exist.
- **Logic**: Only applicable parts are listed for compatible vehicle types (e.g., turbochargers for turbocharged engines, doors for specific body types).

## 2. Year Range and Model Compatibility

- **Rule**: Parts are restricted to specific year ranges and vehicle models.
- **Logic**: Year ranges and mid-cycle refreshes are factored in to prevent incorrect listings (e.g., tail lights from different model years).

## 3. Sectional Vehicle Framework for Part Location

- **Rule**: Parts must be tagged with their exact location on the vehicle.
- **Logic**: Vehicles are divided into nine sections (upper, middle, lower, left, right, front, rear) for easier part identification.

## 4. Dynamic Pricing Logic Based on Market Data

- **Rule**: Prices are dynamically updated based on real-time market data.
- **Logic**: Integrates with platforms like eBay to adjust part pricing based on demand and supply.

## 5. Profitability-Based Removal Order

- **Rule**: Parts are removed in an optimized order based on profitability and removal ease.
- **Logic**: The system prioritizes high-value, easy-to-remove parts, ensuring labor efficiency and maximum profit.

## 6. Condition and Part Suitability

- **Rule**: Only resellable parts are listed.
- **Logic**: AI-powered quality control assesses part condition before listing, avoiding damaged or unprofitable parts.

## 7. Inventory Storage and Volume-Based Optimization

- **Rule**: Parts must be stored in an optimized manner based on size and fragility.
- **Logic**: The system calculates part volume and weight to determine the most suitable storage space, ensuring protection and space efficiency.

## 8. QR Code and SKU Tracking

- **Rule**: Each part is tagged with a unique SKU and QR code for tracking.
- **Logic**: QR codes link to vehicle data, part location, and removal information, ensuring traceability.

## 9. Eco-Friendly Disposal and Recycling

- **Rule**: Non-resellable parts are recycled or disposed of responsibly.
- **Logic**: The system tracks non-sellable parts and channels them for recycling to minimize waste.

## 10. Data-Driven Reporting and Insights

- **Rule**: All dismantling activities are logged and reported for optimization.
- **Logic**: Reports show part performance, inventory turnover, and vehicle profitability trends to guide business decisions.
